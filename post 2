    <h1>Ridiculous, but interesting!</h1>
    <h2><a href="http://salmonofcapistrano.com/">Salmon of Capistrano</a></h2>
    <p> This website is ridiculous and useless and really kind of a waste of internet space. It doesn't do anything other than show you a bunch of salmon while playing "Waterfalls" by TLC on what sounds like a child's piano. After messing around on it for a few minutes though, when I realized that when you tilt your phone screen around, or move your mouse around the screen that your view of the fish moves around, I got to thinking that that could be a very useful feature on a website for a product designer. For example, if I were to launch a website for my jewelry designs, I could use that feature to give customers a chance to see the studio space in which the products are being made, like they're in the studio themselves. It could even be used for an individual item, to give the customer a more real-life feel to the item.</p>
